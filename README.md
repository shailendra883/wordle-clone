- **Color Feedback**: Receive color-coded hints for each letter:
  - **Green**: Correct letter and position.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong position.
  - **Gray**: Incorrect letter.
- **Limited Attempts**: Try to guess the word within a fixed number of attempts.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Live Demo
